== Description ==

The simplest solution to integrate Adsense Ads into Wordpress Content. Just copy your Google Adsense code, paste it and configure where you want to display. 

1. This script will import the GeoLite City CSV file into a usable MySQL table in your database.  ( http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/ )
	The GeoLite databases are our free IP geolocation databases. 
	They are updated on the first Tuesday of each month. 
	These databases are offered in the same binary and csv formats as our subscription databases.

	The GeoLite Developer's Package allows you to distribute GeoLite databases (including updates) royalty-free for one year.
